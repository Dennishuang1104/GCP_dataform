Simplify writing .sqlx and .js (Only support) to replace complex multiple queries

Main functions and features
SQL open source language for managing data transformation jobs
Through Dataform Core, data engineers and data analysts can create data table definitions, set dependencies, add data column descriptions, and set data quality assertions in a single storage area only by using SQL.

Users can gradually adopt and add Dataform Core functions without modifying existing codes.

Dataform Core is an open source tool that can be used in this machine, so that users are not limited to a single framework, and can flexibly use this tool to meet more advanced usage needs.

Fully managed serverless automated scheduling management services for data pipelines
Dataform handles the operational infrastructure to update table content based on dependencies between tables, while also using the latest version of the code. You can use the Dataform integration to smoothly track information related to processes and data, as long as you manually trigger the SQL workflow, or schedule execution through Cloud Composer, Workflows or third-party services.

A full-featured cloud development environment that can be developed through SQL
From a single interface, you can define tables, fix issues with real-time error messages, graph dependencies, publish revisions to Git, and schedule pipelines in minutes without leaving your web browser . In addition, you can link repositories with third-party providers such as GitHub and GitLab, and you can push or open pull requests through the IDE after revision changes.
